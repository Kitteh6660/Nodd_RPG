This is the change log for Nodd RPG, detailing additions and changes.

====================
[0.1.2] - 2021-11-16
This release adds Darkling Row exploration scenes! Drusk also gets some talk scenes to add a bit of lore.
Drusk has finally unveiled the menu of beverages for you to try out! But be careful with Nightmare Fuel!

Added:
+ More Darkling Inn exploration scenes added! Until you discover the Outside Inn, the encounters are predetermined. This should add to the excitement!
+ Outside Inn additions: Drusk talk scenes and drinks menu.
+ Added eye colour!
+ Added sergal appearance description.
+ Added the rest of the codex entries for Sapient Species. Petrid codex entry is now unlockable.

Changes:
* The shops and the Outside Inn are now initially locked.
* Room 6 now requires the key to access. Make sure to talk to Drusk. Currently, it's free, but there will be costs for subsequent nights. No gloam? Suck the bartender off.
* The no-IE page now has buttons that will link you to the corresponding browsers to download.
* Restroom use function is now less placeholdery, with variants depending on whether you have a dick or not. It even accounts for Latex Sheath Suit!
* Moved the player appearance function to its own file due to the size. Should be no visible gameplay changes overall.
* Lust now slowly increases over time, up to a threshold that is dictated by your Libido stat.
* Moved the attribute bars to a tooltip to create room for something new like a map down the line.
* Sergal tails now count as long tails.
* Penile masturbation scene is now much less placeholdery. Thanks Kat!

Fixes:
> Fixed improper nudity description in player appearance screen.

====================
[0.1.1] - 2021-11-13
Notes for developers: Added documentation entry on status effects!

Additions:
+ Attribute selection added to character creation. You can choose your favoured attribute, and your starting attributes.
+ Added Slyne Sorceress as one of the possible random encounters starting at level 3!
+ Added Slyne codex entry.
+ Tease has been split into five parts of your choice. No difference between choices currently though.
+ Wait menu has been added, you can now wait a specified amount of time.
+ Added a stub content for Darkhaze shop. Nothing is buyable yet though...
+ Poison status effect, can happen when a poison bottle hits you.

Changes:
* Increased the experience needed to level up for levels 1 through 3 by 10 each. XP requirement for higher levels is unaffected.
* Performing the (still-placeholdery) victory scenes increase gloam reward to be in line with the city indulging nature.
* Decreased Tank perk from +50 to +25 HP.
* As long as your combined Satiety and Hydration is at least 120 and both of them are at least 40, you will slowly regen HP over time!
* Replaced Nurk Rogue's lust attack with a poison bottle.
* Noddish Dagger drops can now only have a chance to drop if the rogues are level 4 or higher.
* Noddified the day/time display!
* Bladder fill rate now slows down after 90. There still are no consequences to full bladder yet.
* Properly made Nodd RPG incompatible with Internet Explorer 11 and older.
* Implemented items having different maximum stack size. Equipment stacks only to 1 but consumables stack to 10.

Fixes:
> Satiety and Hydration can no longer drop below 0.
> You can now run from combat properly.
> Purchasing from Black Ditch Couture now properly deducts your Gloam.
> Resolved issues with saving after the game directory is moved or run on Edge.

Removals:
- Several unused files, especially the leftover CoC HTML code.

====================
[0.1.0] - 2021-11-11
* Initial code release

Additions:
+ All six Districts, and the Spire which all are pretty barebones at the moment.
+ Induction, Darkling Row, Outside Inn. All of those are still work in progress.
+ Stub for Grud's Grub and Eggpluck's Discount Familiars. 
+ Black Ditch Couture which sells Vulturewear and some armour.
+ Two random battle encounters: Nurk Rogue and Ravel Rogue.
